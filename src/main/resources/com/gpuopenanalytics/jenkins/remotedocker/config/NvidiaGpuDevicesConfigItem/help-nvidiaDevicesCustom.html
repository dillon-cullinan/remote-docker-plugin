    Define <b><code>NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES</code></b> setting for NVIDIA Container Runtime using a comma-separated list
    of GPU UUID(s) or GPU index(es).<br/><br/>
    <b>NOTE:</b> Specifiying GPU(s) to use can cause issues unless you are certain of the GPU environment for which the
    container will be executed on. The best way to ensure proper execution is to target machines with tags by the
    Jenkins project and restrict execution to those tags.<br/><br/>
